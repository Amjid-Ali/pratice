The data includes approximately 20,000 action sequences and a total of 5.4 million frames. Each video lasts around 3 to 4 minutes, recorded at 30 FPS. |
| 3 | [InfAR](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231216307044) | 10 | InfAR consists of 600 short clips, each approximately 4 seconds long, recorded at 25 FPS with a resolution of 293 × 256 using IR thermal imaging cameras. |
| 4 | [UCLA Multiview](https://wangjiangb.github.io/my_data.html) | 10 | This dataset includes 1,475 RGB sequences captured simultaneously from three camera views, with each action performed by 10 different subjects. |
| 5 | [TVSum](https://github.com/yalesong/tvsum) | 10 | This dataset includes 50 videos sourced from YouTube, showcasing 10 different types of activities such as animal healthcare, dog shows, and various stunts. Each category has five videos, and a total of 20 users manually created ground truth (GT) summaries for these videos. The typical duration of videos in this dataset ranges from 1 to 5 minutes, with an average length of around 4 minutes and 18 seconds. |
| 6 | [SumMe](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-10584-0_33) | Not specified | This dataset consists of 25 videos that depict a variety of activities including cooking, festivals, sports, and holidays, also obtained from YouTube. The videos vary in length from 1.5 to 6.5 minutes, with a mean duration of about 2 minutes and 40 seconds. Each video has 15 to 18 user-generated summaries that are utilized for training and evaluation. |
| 7 | [UCF Crime](https://arxiv.org/abs/1801.04264) | 14 | The UCF-Crime dataset is a large-scale, untrimmed video collection consisting of 1,900 videos that total 128 hours. It includes one normal class and 13 types of real-world anomalies, both indoor and outdoor, captured against diverse, complex backgrounds. The dataset ensures a balanced distribution of normal and abnormal scenes across the training and testing subsets. Training videos only feature video-level labels, while temporal annotations are provided solely for the testing videos. |
| 8 | [LAD-2000](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.08570) | 14 | The LAD-2000 dataset is a large-scale benchmark for video anomaly detection, consisting of 2,000 video sequences that cover 14 types of anomalies, including crashes, fires, and violence. It provides both video-level and frame-level labels. |
| 9 | [CUHK Avenue](https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/leojia/projects/detectabnormal/dataset.html) | 2 | This dataset consists of 37 videos at 640×360 resolution, split into 16 training and 21 testing videos. It includes abnormal activities like loitering, throwing, and running, each video lasting two minutes. The dataset provides pixel-level annotations across approximately 31,000 frames captured from a stationary camera. |
| 10 | [ShanghaiTech](https://svip-lab.github.io/dataset/campus_dataset.html) | 2 | This dataset is a medium-sized benchmark for video anomaly detection (VAD), consisting of 437 surveillance video clips. It includes 330 training videos and 107 testing videos, capturing 13 types of anomalous scenes from various angles and lighting conditions. The dataset features 130 abnormal events, such as chasing, jumping, and motorbike activities. |
| 11 | [RWF-2000](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1911.05913) | 2 | The RWF-2000 dataset is a large-scale collection of 2,000 video clips, each 5 seconds long, captured from surveillance cameras in real-world settings. These clips are evenly divided between violent and non-violent behaviors, facilitating the development and evaluation of violence detection algorithms. |
